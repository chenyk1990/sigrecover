## NOTES:

1. The scripts beginning with "test_" are runnable scripts.

2. The directory [subroutines](https://github.com/chenyk1990/sigrecover/tree/main/subroutines) stores all the required subroutines. 

3. The current version is based on Matlab. Future versions may also support Python and be optimized regarding computational efficiency. 

4. All figures (except for fig1, which is a schematic plot) in the sigrecover paper are in the following directory for a quick look (https://github.com/chenyk1990/gallery/tree/main/sigrecover). 

5. The label fonts are different across different Matlab versions and platforms (Linux, Max). The figures presented in the paper are from Mac-Pro Matlab 2022b.

## Gallery
The gallery figures of the sigrecover package can be found at
    https://github.com/chenyk1990/gallery/tree/main/sigrecover
Each figure in the gallery directory corresponds to a test_figNO.m script in the "main" directory with the exactly the same file name (figNO.png).

These gallery figures are also presented below.
